# Social Media App Backend 🌐💬

A backend service for a social media application, built using express js and mysql. The project structure includes:

- **`config/`**: Configuration files for the application.
- **`controllers/`**: Logic for handling requests.
- **`errors/`**: Error handling utilities.
- **`middlewares/`**: Custom middleware functions.
- **`routes/`**: Route definitions for API endpoints.
- **`static/images/`**: Static images for the application.
- **`utils/`**: Utility functions.


## Frontend Integration

The project also includes a frontend application, which was initially a pre-developed template. I migrated the template from HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to **Next.js**. After refactoring, I successfully integrated the frontend with the backend I've developed.
